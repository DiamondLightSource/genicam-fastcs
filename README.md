# genicam_fastcs

FastCS support for a GeniCam

This is where you should write a short paragraph that describes what your module does,
how it does it, and why people should use it.

Source          | <https://github.com/DiamondLightSource/genicam-fastcs>
:---:           | :---:
PyPI            | `pip install genicam-fastcs`
Docker          | `docker run ghcr.io/diamondlightsource/genicam-fastcs:latest`
Releases        | <https://github.com/DiamondLightSource/genicam-fastcs/releases>

This is where you should put some images or code snippets that illustrate
some relevant examples. If it is a library then you might put some
introductory code here:

```python
from genicam_fastcs import __version__

print(f"Hello genicam_fastcs {__version__}")
```

Or if it is a commandline tool then you might put some example commands here:

```
python -m genicam_fastcs --version
```
